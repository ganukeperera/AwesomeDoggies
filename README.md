    This app is for dog lovers! Users can view lists of all available dog breeds and can select a prefered breed to view all photos available. Also user can mark/unmark specific photos as favourite. All of these were possible thanks to the free dog API @ <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api">DOG CEO</a>
